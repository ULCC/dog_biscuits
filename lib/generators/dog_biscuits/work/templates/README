After creating your work you may wish to:

  1. Customize the Work (the 'dog_biscuits way'):

  in config/initializers/dog_biscuits.rb change the defaults:

    fields to display in search results:
      config.index_properties

    fields to display as facets:
      config.facet_properties

    properties and order in the form and show page:
      config.your_work_properties

    required fields in the form
      config.your_work_properties_required
      
    Restart your application to see changes take effect.
  
  2. Further modify the model, indexer, actor, form or presenter

  Remember that if you re-run the Work generator, select 'n' if you have made local changes:
    rails g dog_biscuits:work Work
  
  You can ensure the model and indexer are not overwritten with the --skipmodel flag
    rails g dog_biscuits:work Work --skipmodel

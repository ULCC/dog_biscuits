After creating your work you may wish to:

  1. Customize the show page

  2. Customize facets and search results

  3. Further modify the model, actor, form or presenter

Customizing a Work the 'dog_biscuits way':

  in config/initializers/dog_biscuits.rb change the defaults:

    fields to display in search results:
      config.index_properties

    fields to display as facets:
      config.facet_properties

    properties and order in the form and show page:
      config.your_work_properties

    required fields in the form
      config.your_work_properties_required

  Re-run the Work generators (these will overwrite any local changes):
    rails g dog_biscuits:work Work

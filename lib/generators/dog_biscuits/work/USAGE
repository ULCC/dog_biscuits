Description:
    The DogBiscuits Work generator makes the following changes to your application:
    1. Checks that the requested Work is supported by DogBiscuits
    2. Runs the Hyrax generator for the given model
    3. Creates a new model, form, presenter and indexer to replace the Hyrax one
    4. Creates views/hyrax/work_name_plural/_attribute_rows.html.erb
    5. Updates the schema_org config, hyrax (en) locale using the configured properties for the work

Example:
    rails generate dog_biscuits:work ConferenceItem

Making changes post-generation:
    You can make most of the changes you'll need (property selection, order, required etc.)
      in config/initializers/dog_biscuits.rb. You do not need to re-run the generator 
      for these changes to take effect.
    If you have changed labels, help_text or schema_org mappings in the property_mappings config:
      re-run the locales generator with `rails g dog_biscuits:locales`
      re-run the schema_org generator with `rails g dog_biscuits:schema_org`

Adding local properties
    Add the local property into the model (in app/models/)
    Add an attribute into the solr_document (app/models/solr_document.rb)
    Add the property to the config (config/initializers/dog_biscuits.rb)

    Add custom helper methods or renderers (in app/helpers/ and app/renderers)
      and add them to the property_mappings.

    The generator can be re-run without overwriting the model and indexer files using the --skipmodel option
      although, as noted above, you should not need to re-run the generator

Example:
    rails generate dog_biscuits:work ConferenceItem --skipmodel
      or (to update only labels, help_text and schema_org mappings)
    rails g dog_biscuits:locales
    rails g dog_biscuits:schema_org
